# SEBI BRSR Standards - ESG Scope 3 Compliance

## Overview

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) framework requires listed companies to disclose their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance.

**Reference**: SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CMD-2/P/CIR/2021/562 (May 10, 2021)

## Principle 6: Businesses should respect and make efforts to protect and restore the environment

### Question 2: Non-renewable energy consumption and related disclosures

**Mandatory Disclosures (SEBI BRSR Format):**

1. **Total Non-Renewable Energy Consumed** (in Joules or multiples)
   - Coal, Natural Gas, Diesel, Petrol, Other petroleum products
   - Percentage of non-renewable energy from total energy consumption
   - Year-on-year comparison with baseline

2. **Energy Intensity Metrics**
   - Energy consumption per unit of production
   - Energy consumption per rupee of turnover

### Scope 3 - Category 4: Upstream Transportation and Distribution

**Required Disclosures:**

1. **Quantitative Metrics**
   - Total CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions from upstream transportation
   - Breakdown by transport mode (air, sea, road, rail)
   - Emissions per ton-kilometer where applicable

2. **Supplier Engagement**
   - Evidence of supplier emission data collection
   - Supplier-specific emission factors (preferred over industry averages)
   - Documentation of data quality and verification methods

3. **Data Quality Indicators**
   - Source of emission factors (supplier-provided, industry average, calculated)
   - Uncertainty ranges or confidence levels
   - Third-party verification status

4. **Improvement Initiatives**
   - Targets for reducing transportation emissions
   - Initiatives to optimize logistics and reduce carbon footprint
   - Progress against previous year's performance

## Compliance Criteria for GreenTrust AI

### Trust Score Components

1. **Data Completeness (30%)**
   - All required fields present (CO2e, supplier ID, route, mode)
   - Supporting documentation available
   - Emission factors disclosed

2. **Verification Quality (40%)**
   - Deviation from industry benchmarks ≤15%
   - Supplier-specific data used (bonus points)
   - Third-party verification (bonus points)

3. **Disclosure Standards (30%)**
   - Alignment with GHG Protocol and SEBI Principle 6 Question 2
   - Transparency in methodology
   - Consistency with previous reporting

### Minimum Requirements

- **Trust Score ≥60**: Acceptable for BRSR compliance
- **Trust Score <60**: Requires remediation before disclosure
- **Deviation >15%**: Automatic flag for review

## Red Flags (Automatic Human Review)

- Missing supplier identification
- Unrealistic emission values (>200% or <50% of benchmark)
- Inconsistent transport mode and route data
- No documentation of emission factor source
- Lack of year-over-year comparison
- **Greenwashing indicators**: Zero emissions without credible certification
- **High-risk regions**: Conflict zones or sanctioned countries

## Best Practices

1. Use supplier-specific emission factors whenever possible
2. Maintain audit trail of all data sources
3. Conduct third-party verification for material emissions
4. Implement continuous monitoring and improvement
5. Engage suppliers in emission reduction initiatives
6. **Align with SEBI Principle 6 Question 2** for energy consumption disclosure
